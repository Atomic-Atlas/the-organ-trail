Maddy:

1. What role do certain emotions play in the function of the brain?
	- Maddy studies stress a lot and how those things can shut down a lot of those other bodily functions.
	- Certain body parts can shut down if maybe you do something wrong.


2. What made you want to study neuroscience? Do you have any suggestions or ideas as to how we could convey this passion through the game's narrative or mechanics?

	- Started studying because she's in pre-med and likes the emotional aspect that's very interconnected with psych.
		- How do we learn things?
		- How do we process the world around us.
	- Likes learning about something that we're still learning about.
	- Learning aspect: make the story line revolve around learning.
		- Player earns different kinds of neurons when they learn things.
			- Earn different abilities that the brain has.
			- Brain is a massive pile of neurons, the more you have of them, the more creases that form,
			because it's trying to scrunch up for massive surface area.
			- Surface space is important for blood flow and it actually has oxygen to work.
			- Earn more blood connections to the brain(?), more connections (?)
				- Start out as caveman, work your way to being the smartest human today.


3. Why does the human brain fascinate you?
	- It's so unknown.
		- The reasoning behind EVERYTHING we do can be traced back to the brain.
			- Answers a lot of questions.


4. How do you think advancements in neuroscience could change our understanding of other human organs in the next decade?
	- It can help us understand how much we are able to conciously control vs. subconciously control.
	- We might learn that there's more things we can actually think about and control.
	- There's some things that our body does on its own and we can think about doing.
		- e.g. blinking, breathing.
	- However, we can't tell our heart to stop or start beating.


5. Can you describe an interesting concept about the human brain that others might not know about? How would you explain it to someone without a neuroscience background?
	- Concept: Short-term stress is good, but long-term stress 
	- Short-term good; long-term bad.
		- Helps you get out of the situation that got you stressed in the first place.
		- Not being able to digest your food for a very short amount of time (short-term) is not as bad compared to not being able to do that for a long amount of time (long-term).
	- If the stress is caused by something you can't fix immediately on your own, then the stress isn't gonna go away.


6. Are there any misconceptions about the brain that you're aware of?
	- You use ALL of your brain. Saying you only use 10% is a misconception.
	- You have folds in your brain to maximize the space you have in there.
	- Folds are created more frequently as a kid because your neurons are more primed to multiply.
	- Neurogenesis
	- Are certain people more 
	- When you're older, most of learning occurs in the hippocampus.
	- The older you get, the harder it is for you to make new neurons.
		- One of the reasons older people are stuck in their ways.


7. What do you think is the most underappreciated part about the human brain (or any other organ), and why?
	- The liver is very fucking cool and very underrated.
		- The only organ we have that regenerate itself with a significant amount of reliability.
	- If you surgically removed half of your liver, it could grow back significantly fast.
	- There needs to be more research like stem cell research.
	- You could cut a little less than half of a liver off, bring it to a person receiving a transplant, and both livers will grow back significantly.
	- Alcohol causes scaring of the liver and prevents it from regenerating.
		- Can't treat people with liver diseases by cutting off the bad part and having it just regrow.
		- In that case, someone would need their whole bad liver removed and a whole healthy one put in.


8. If you could pick one part of the brain to recognize for its importance, what would it be and why?
	- Amygdala
	- Very small structure, people call it the "nut" of the brain because it's the size of a nut
	- Responsible for FEAR
	- Plays a role in stress: you have to be a little scared to be stressed.
	- Also plays a role in learning: FEAR learning, where you learn to avoid things because they're scary or dangerous.
	- Also responsible for a lot of other emotions, but fear is its biggest one.
